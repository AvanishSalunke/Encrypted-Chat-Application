# Future Scope and Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the major planned features and improvements for the chat application, expanding upon the existing one-to-one chat functionality.

## 1. Feature Expansion: Group Chats

The immediate priority is introducing multi-user conversations through Group Chats.

- **Group Creation:**
    
    - Allow users to create groups, define names, and add optional descriptions/icons. 
        
- **Member Management:**
    
    - Implement tools for group admins (creators) to add, remove, and manage administrative roles for members. 
        
- **Real-Time Group Messaging:**
    
    - Enable seamless, real-time message sending and receiving within all group threads. 
        
- **Notifications:**
    
    - Ensure users receive appropriate and timely notifications for new messages in groups they belong to.
        

## 2. Rich Media Support (Image Sharing)

This includes adding support for sharing image files securely in both one-to-one and group chats.

- **Image Upload:**
    
    - Allow users to select and upload images directly from their devices. 
        
- **Secure Storage & Retrieval:**
    
    - Store images securely and generate time-limited, authenticated URLs for display. 
        
- **In-Chat Preview:**
    
    - Display a clear, thumbnail-sized preview of the image within the chat component, with an option to view the full-size version.
        

## 3. User Interface (UI) and Experience (UX) Improvements

Enhancing the application's look, responsiveness, and overall usability.

- **Responsive Design:**
    
    - Refactor styling (using Tailwind CSS) to ensure the app looks and works great on **all screen sizes** (mobile, tablet, desktop).
        
- **Theming:**
    
    - Implement a **light/dark mode** toggle based on user preference or system settings.
        
- **Presence Indicators:**
    
    - Add **"typing..."** indicators and **last-seen timestamps** to give users better context in conversations. 
        
- **Search Functionality:**
    
    - Introduce a search bar to quickly find contacts, group chats, and easily search message history. 
        

## 4. Deployment and Scalability

Setting up a robust infrastructure for testing, stability, and future growth.

- **Staging Environment:**
    
    - Set up a parallel, non-production environment for comprehensive testing of new features before they go live.
        
- **Performance Optimization:**
    
    - Review and optimize data fetching logic, particularly for loading long message histories and media. 
        
- **Domain & Hosting:**
    
    - Deploy the final application to a reliable hosting provider under a custom domain.
