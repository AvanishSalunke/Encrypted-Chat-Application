# WebSockets in the Secure Chat App

WebSockets are a foundational technology for this project, enabling the real-time, bidirectional communication that is essential for a modern chat application.

## What are WebSockets?

A WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides a full-duplex, persistent connection between a client (like a user's browser) and a server.

Think of traditional HTTP as sending letters. The client sends a request (a letter), and the server sends a response (a letter back). The conversation is a series of separate exchanges. A WebSocket, on the other hand, is like a telephone call. The client "calls" the server once to open a connection, and that line stays open, allowing both sides to talk freely and instantly until one of them hangs up.

## Why Use WebSockets for a Chat Application?

Using WebSockets is critical for creating a responsive and seamless user experience.

* **Low Latency:** As soon as a message is sent, it's pushed through the open connection to the recipient almost instantly. There's no need for the client to constantly ask the server, "Are there any new messages?"
* **Full-Duplex Communication:** Data can flow in both directions at the same time. The server can push messages to the client at any moment, which is perfect for receiving new messages, typing indicators, and presence updates (e.g., online status).
* **Efficiency:** After the initial connection (the "handshake"), the data frames sent back and forth have very little overhead compared to the bulky headers of HTTP requests. This saves bandwidth and improves performance.

## Securing WebSockets (WSS) 

Given the application's focus on security, all WebSocket connections are established using the **Secure WebSocket protocol (`wss://`)**.

`WSS` is to `WS` what `HTTPS` is to `HTTP`. It means that the WebSocket connection is layered on top of a **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** tunnel. The initial handshake is done over HTTPS, and all subsequent WebSocket data is automatically encrypted by the same TLS layer that secures the rest of the application's traffic.

This prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the communication channel between the client and the server. It secures the "pipe," while the End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) secures the message *inside* the pipe.

## Implementation in This Project

In our architecture, the **Spring Boot** backend exposes a WebSocket endpoint. The **React** frontend client initiates a connection to this endpoint. Once the secure handshake is complete, this persistent connection is used to:

1.  Send new chat messages from the client to the server.
2.  Push incoming messages from the server to the correct recipient client in real time.
3.  Transmit real-time events like typing notifications.
